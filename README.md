# MyReads Project

This is a React Web Application for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree. A static web page was provided and I refactored it into a React Web Application.

## How to Use this Web Application

Download or clone the repository. Launch the `index.html` file using `npm start`

Search for terms on the search page and add books to a 'shelf'. The shelves are '**Currently Reading**', '**Want to Read**', and '**Read**'. Books that are not assigned to a shelf will be shown to have a shelf of **None**.

## Dependencies

This project uses `React.js`, `React Router DOM`, and a `BooksAPI` provided by Udacity.
